I am a Business Analytics undergraduate at the National University of Singapore, with a Minor in Quantitative Finance and a strong interest in applying data science and machine learning to solve real-world problems in finance. My experience includes serving as a Quantitative Researcher at the NUS Fintech Society, a Teaching Assistant for Business Analytics, and a Business Analytics Intern at Munich Re, where I gained practical experience in data pipeline automation and performance monitoring. I have been recognized with the Deanâ€™s List award for AY2024/25 and hold certifications in Applied Data Science and AI Literacy. Recently, I was selected for the prestigious NUS Overseas Colleges (NOC) programme in London, where I aim to further explore the intersection of fintech, AI, and entrepreneurship.
